## 🚀 Introduction

Chickens are susceptible to various diseases, which can lead to significant economic losses in the poultry industry. This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify chicken diseases based on images, providing a quick and effective tool for farmers to assess the health of their flock.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of images categorized into healthy and various diseased chicken classes. You can download the dataset from the following link:

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Om700-create/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Projects.git
cd Chicken-Disease-Classification-Projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
📖 Usage
Training the Model
Run the following command to train the classification model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Making Predictions
To classify a new chicken image, use:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path_to_your_image
Example Command:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image ./images/chicken.jpg
🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
The model is built using a CNN architecture, incorporating data augmentation techniques to improve performance and robustness. The training process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and augmentation of images.
Model Architecture: Implementation of the CNN model.
Training & Validation: Training on the dataset and validation against a test set.
Evaluation: Metrics to assess model performance.
📈 Results
The model achieves an impressive accuracy of X% on the validation set. For detailed metrics and evaluation results, check the evaluation section in the train.py file.
