#### Problem Statement:
“Numerous chickens are currently affected by coccidiosis, a potentially devastating disease that demands expert assessment for accurate diagnosis. Coccidiosis poses a significant threat to poultry health, making it crucial to identify and treat infected birds promptly. Given the complexity of diagnosing this condition, specialized knowledge and skills are essential to effectively detect and manage cases. By relying on AI techniques, we can ensure the well-being of our chicken flocks and take appropriate measures to prevent further spread of the disease.”


To solve this problem, we will use the dataset of fecal images to classify and apply various techniques of machine learning.
